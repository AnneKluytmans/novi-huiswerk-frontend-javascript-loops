# JavaScript Loop Practice

This repository contains a series of JavaScript exercises focused on practicing **loops**, **arrays**, and **objects** — from basic to more complex challenges.

## Files

- `loops.js` – Basic loop exercises
- `loops-and-arrays.js` – Loops combined with arrays
- `loops-arrays-objects.js` – Working with loops, arrays, and objects together

Each file contains a set of exercises.

## Running the Code

You can run each file using **nodemon** in your terminal:

```bash
nodemon loops.js
```

When switching files, stop nodemon with Ctrl + C, then run the next one:

```bash
nodemon loops-and-arrays.js
```

Make sure nodemon is installed globally or via npm install nodemon -g.
